## About The Project
A short Github repo for storing the PCB Files used to aid in the creation of this 7 segment PCB design. The PCB logic and Design was done using the Proteus design software. a 555 astable timer circuit and JK flip-flop were used for the counter purposes, meanwhile Logic gates were used to process respective displayed alphanumericals. The end-result PCB displays my registration number and first 3 initials, as shown below.
